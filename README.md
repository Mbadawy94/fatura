## About Fatura's task

This task was really a challenge to me. I have learned a lot during this task as there is some new features I make for the first time.
In this task I have made some efforts, such as:

- Analysing the sent document.
- Making ER diagram.
- Creating CRUD opreations for Users, Products ,and Roles.
- Using spatie package for the first time to make rules and permissions and reading throw the documentation to learn it and make my project with it.
- Making Models, Controllers, Migrations, Routes ,and views to make CRUD opreations.
- Using Laravel ui package and bootstrap auth scaffolding package to make authintication.
